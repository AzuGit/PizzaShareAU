## About this project:

PizzaShare allows anyone who has a community of fans or followers of some kind to receive small donations or rewards for their work. The tool allows us to facilitate the donation process with one-click payments using a web wallet3 like Metamask and receive the money directly in the wallet itself. 

It is possible to create our post to show what we do or what we will do with the money received, as well as include comments from our followers. 

### Future improvements:
Customize thank you messages.

Implement in several networks (Polygon, BNB chain) the smart contract.

Adjustment of the established rate for payments with reference in USDT.
